## Introduction

Welcome to the tutorial on utilizing Xilinx Alveo FPGAs as SmartNICs within the ESnet framework. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of setting up, configuring, and utilizing the power of Xilinx Alveo FPGAs for network acceleration using the ESnet framework.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, this tutorial assumes that you have access to a pre-configured system that has already been tested for development and deployment using the ESnet framework. **If you are a student taking CS 595 at IIT in Fall 2023, Airfield would be your pre-configured system. Please note that everything mentioned in this tutorial has been tested on Airfield.** 

Please make sure you have the following (if you are taking CS 595 you can ignor this step):

- Basic understanding of FPGA programming and networking concepts
- Xilinx Vivado 2023.1
- A valid VitisNetworkingP4 license
